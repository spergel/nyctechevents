      "description": "https://lu.ma/43m8iiy5\n\n​The cabbage Salon is a space for curious minds, deep discussions, and unexpected connections. Each gathering brings people together to engage with big ideas—guided by a speaker, and shaped by the thoughts, experiences, and perspectives of everyone in the room.\n\n​No academic background required—just a willingness to think, share, and listen.\n\n​This salon is inspired by the texts of Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Thomas Nagel, Max Horkheimer, Theodor W. Adorno, and Robert Nozick.*\n\n​The Self…\n\n​We take for granted that each of us has a self—an “I.” The “I” in “I see the tree” or “I like this band.” But if we take a closer look, the “I”, that we are, becomes strangely elusive: If we try to focus on our pure “I”—stripped of any thought beyond the self-aware “I”—it slips from our grasp. The closer we try to get to it, the further it moves away. Trippy! What can we learn from philosophy about the nature of the self?\n\n​...and Other Drgs**\n\n​What are we seeking when we take mind-altering substances? The list of possible answers is long: self-improvement, self-destruction, self-purification... Do we seek liberation, community, chaos, or the unknown? None of the above? And what if there were a drg—inexpensive, free from side effects—that simply made us happier? Should we take it? Why—or why not? \n\n​Presented By:\n\n​Georg Spoo, PhD. is an Assistant Professor of Philosophy, who practiced his Postdoc at Columbia University. His academic research focus is on epistemology, social and political philosophy, and existentialism. He currently consults with companies to incorporate philosophical ideas into the practical business world. Teams have benefitted from Georg’s discussions on the philosophy of decision-making so they’re equipped to make better ones. At the heart of Georg’s beliefs is that everyone should live in peace, and no one should have to suffer inequality.\n\n​How We Do Things:\n\n​🔹 Warm-Up: We start with a short icebreaker to get minds moving and ideas flowing.\n🔹 Talk & Discussion: Our guest speaker introduces the theme, sharing insights and questions to consider.\n🔹 Group Conversations: Attendees break into small groups to explore the topic, bringing their own ideas and experiences into the mix.\n🔹 More Talk, More Conversation: Our speaker presents a second round of thoughts, deepening the discussion before another round of open dialogue.\n🔹 Final Thoughts & Closing: We wrap up with reflections, takeaways, and an open floor for last thoughts.\n\n​This is not a lecture—it’s a conversation. Bring your point of view, your questions, and your curiosity. Get weird, get controversial, get real, baby. \n\n​Come for the ideas, stay for the drinks, lovers, and friends. 🍷\n\n​*If you'd like to dig deeper on these texts, it is absolutely not required and you won't feel lost if you haven't. But we've put them together for you here, anyways.\n\n​**idk what the rules of the Internet are these days please don't clown us for censoring\n\n​***Seating is limited, so first come first serve. But standing is good for you, someone said somewhere once.\n\n​****If cost is an issue, please reach out @cabbagehousekids, everyone is welcome!",

And Ikebana—the traditional Japanese art of flower arranging—allows us to play with movement, texture, and shape in order to create botanical sculptures. In this Gather, we’ll use farm fresh flowers, dried foliage, minimal ingredients, and simple mechanics to create two Ikebana designs. One design will be in a provided Ikebana vessel, and the other will be done in a vessel we’ve each brought with us. We’ll learn to attach flower frogs and explore different design approaches. We’ll then celebrate each others’ art pieces while enjoying light snacks and conversation.",

In this Gather, we’ll explore how we make marks on a surface—like stamping with ink, drawing with a comb, and painting on yupo paper. We will experiment with these tools to create our own unique and unexpected textures. This can open up a new vocabulary of textures to apply to our creative practices across any medium.",

The walks will be designed for New Yorkers to see New York through the eyes of an architect: seeking to understand the big picture while appreciating the details. In this curated route, we will focus on the historic architecture of Harlem. As a neighborhood, Harlem is part physical, part mythical. The famed renaissance that transpired a hundred years ago has indelibly shaped the neighborhood’s identity as a Mecca culture and placemaking in New York City. We will be cultivating the art of city walking, not as tourists, but as architecture-aficionados, learning to appreciate the details of Harlem’s most distinct buildings and brownstones.",

In this Gather, we’ll explore our relationship to flowers, learning the feelings of different colors, textures, and forms of floral composition. We’ll spend time free-drawing with our whole bodies to get comfortable with natural flow. We’ll shake and tap the flowers to get a sense of how each flower moves, listening to their organic nature and to how they want to be. We’ll learn to construct our own bouquets connected to specific themes, occasions, or emotions that we want to express.",

Through a guided writing time, we’ll explore seven different movements of the mind—different mental approaches to the same item or event. This gets us out of our usual patterns of thinking and remembering, and also gets us out of the anxiety of “what am I going to write?” We’ll then craft a poem from the phrases we’ve unearthed. We’ll learn how to approach writing in a less direct and less pressured manner, and how to find the poetry that’s already there—in our own voices, in our own minds.",

      "description": "Eyewitness to War: A Reporter’s Quest for Truth Amid a Landscape of Death and Deception\n  \nJoin Explorers Club fellow and award-winning journalist Scott Wallace for a startling look into the armed conflicts that rocked Central America in the 1980s. \n  \nThis richly illustrated multimedia lecture will take the audience on an unforgettable journey into the jungles and bullet-scarred villages of Central America during the upheaval of the 1980s. Danger lurks at every turn as Scott Wallace ventures up rebel-infested mountain roads, boards helicopters buzzing the treetops to dodge heat-seeking missiles, and travels by dugout canoe along hotly contested waterways in his quest to uncover the truth. Based on his new visual and written memoir, Central America in the Crosshairs of War, the lecture will also raise timely questions about U.S. foreign policy, the uses of American military power, and the origins of the current immigration crisis on the southern border. This lecture will especially appeal to those interested in the intersection of exploration and war reportage, human and Indigenous rights, war photography, and the business of reporting the news in a time of widespread deception and disinformation. \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. Scott will also have copies of his book available for signing. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Monday, February 24th at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

Myers takes readers on a journey from the beginning of time to modern days, exploring how weather and climate impacted historic events around the globe in his book Invisible Iceberg: When Climate and Weather Shaped History. \nFrom the comet that ended the age of the dinosaur 66 million years ago, to engrossing stories about how weather and climate led to the rise and fall of empires, caused plagues to spread, inspired works of art, and thoughts on whether the movements of a cold front and a nearby hurricane could have thwarted the 9/11 attacks, the book highlights dozens of fascinating events from history, along with thought-provoking insight about how weather and climate are stitched into the outcomes of these historic occurrences. \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Monday, March 3rd at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

      "description": "Join the Explorers Club and the Breaking Barriers committee on March 10th to celebrate the life of pioneering author and explorer Anne Morrow Lindbergh. \n  \nOn May 27th, 1929, Anne Spencer Morrow, a quite shy, prize-winning English major and graduate of Smith College, married Charles A. Lindbergh, the most famous aviator of his time and the world’s first media star. Not surprisingly this changed her life radically. In five years, by 1934, she would be referred to in the media as the “First Lady of Aviation” on her own merits. This amazing transformation would not only include her learning to fly, getting her radio license, and becoming a fully licensed glider pilot, but also opened the door to many very real flying accomplishments and adventures as she accompanied her husband as navigator, radio operator, and co-pilot, exploring the uses of aviation, then a new technology, in exploration, science, communication, and relief work. \nAnne’s contributions to exploration include: \n\nActing as co-pilot and navigator with her husband to set a transcontinental record.\nSpotting from the air an important and previously undiscovered Mayan temple.\nPhoto-documenting areas of the Canyon de Chelly that are still extremely difficult to reach.\nIdentifying a previously unknown mountain range in Greenland.\nFlying 40,000 miles with her husband acting as co-pilot, radio operator, and navigator, surveying national and international air routes, many still in use today.\nMaking a record breaking radio transmission of 3,000 miles, establishing a new long distance record.\n\nHer two books on her flying experiences during the Golden Age of Flight were best sellers and won the National Bookseller Association National Book Awards for non-fiction. Her first book, NORTH TO THE ORIENT, marking it’s 90th year in print in 2025, won the first National Book Award for non-fiction in 1935. \n  \n \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Monday, March 10th at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

Hearing directly from Inuit across the Canadian Arctic and Greenland, these videos explore a diversity of topics, including Inuit observations of bear abundance and health, human-bear encounters and safety, tracking and hunting bears, cooking and eating bears, the cultural and emotional connections to bears, and Inuit recommendations for polar bear management. \nThis event will be presented by David Borish, the director of this initiative, who is also an EC50 Class of 2023 member. David will screen a variety of short films that hear from community voices, and talk about the process of co-creating films in partnership with Inuit communities, wildlife co-management boards, local filmmakers, researchers, and others. David will also share his experience filming polar bears across the Arctic, including skidooing in temperatures below -40 fahrenheit, and the sailing through the Northwest Passage on Le Commandant Charcot icebreaker. \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Friday, March 14th at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

      "description": "Sometimes, one moment on an expedition can be so impactful it changes the way we think about the world around us, even for a veteran explorer familiar with the area. This is what happened to Tom Paradise and his team when the fierce Khamsin desert winds enveloped his expedition party in Wadi Rum last year. Join Tom and The Explorers Club for a personal account and investigation into this powerful phenomenon.  \nHaving worked in southern Jordan since 1990, Tom Paradise has slept in Bedouin tents, studied the desert, climbed Mount Nebo and Jebel Haroun – the legendary burial sites of Moses and his brother Aaron, and has documented hundreds of Nabatean tombs and monuments. However, the rare, and often ferocious Khamsin winds have constantly eluded Paradise and his teams. However, in May 2024, when on an Explorers Club Flag Expedition in Wadi Rum near the Saudi border, he and his group were fortuitously loaded with field equipment when the extraordinary winds hit. Lasting only 83 minutes, the southerly winds stirred up the desert floor creating a solid wall of dust and sand.  The gales gusted up to 100 kph (65mph) while the team recorded the dramatic event. Not only was it an outrageous experience, these ‘winds of legend‘ profoundly challenged our understanding about desert landforms and environmental dynamics. Was such a rare and savage episode able to change the desert cliffs and dune fields blowing only a few hours each year, or was it our current conventional theories of everyday processes (uniformitarianism) that truly change the landscape around us?  For a team of veteran field geoscientists and grad students, our way of looking at desert landforms was changed forever… \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Monday, March 17th at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

      "description": "When faced with drought, how do Africa’s great predators adjust their behavior to survive? Join Leigh West, a wildlife researcher and Explorers Club grantee, as she shares how lions, leopards, cheetahs, and African wild dogs change their movements when water sources dwindle and prey becomes scarce. Discover how these predators interact with one another and share the landscape with people as they adapt to increasingly frequent and severe environmental challenges. \nThrough captivating stories from her fieldwork in Botswana’s Okavango Delta, Leigh will reveal how understanding predator behavior during extreme climate events can help foster coexistence between people and wildlife. Using 13 years of GPS data from these carnivores encompassing several droughts, Leigh’s research highlights how drought can reshape carnivore behavior, from shifting movement patterns to changing exposure to humans, and has direct implications for conservation in a changing climate. \nPerfect for adventurers, conservationists, and anyone fascinated by the resilience of wildlife and the challenges of living alongside them! \n \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Monday, March 24th at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

It was her sixth summit of the peak and the culmination of nine seasons of working as a mountain guide on Everest and around the world. The journey to arriving at the summit, and surviving the descent, was one filled with physical and emotional challenges that required her to dive deep into her own motivation for being there and face the truth of the life and death stakes of trying something nearly impossible. To celebrate the release of her memoir, ENOUGH: CLIMBING TOWARD A TRUE SELF ON MOUNT EVEREST, Melissa will share the story behind her motivation, the road to being ready, and the details of her historic climb–most of which have never been shared publicly. A story of personal reflection, growth, and healing on the highest peak on earth containing lessons learned in the mountains, but of use to everyone regardless of what your own mountain is in life. \n  \n \n  \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A.

      "description": "On the evening of April 14—113 years after the Titanic struck the iceberg that sealed its fate—this presentation explores three areas of study worth continuing on the legendary vessel.  \nFirst, we’ll examine how the Titanic serves as a living laboratory for marine biologists and oceanographers. The wreck has become an unprecedented case study of deep-sea decomposition, offering insights into how metal structures deteriorate in extreme conditions and supporting unique ecosystems of “rusticles” and specialized microorganisms. \nThe second segment addresses the ongoing ethical debate surrounding salvage operations. We’ll analyze the tension between preserving historical artifacts and maintaining the site’s integrity as a maritime grave, examining recent court decisions and competing claims from salvage companies and preservation groups. \nFinally, we’ll delve into the often-overlooked ethnic diversity among Titanic’s passengers. While popular media typically focuses on wealthy first-class travelers from the United States and United Kingdom, the ship carried a rich tapestry of immigrants from across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. We’ll explore the stories of passengers from places like Lebanon, Croatia, and even China, examining their reasons for travel and how their experiences reflect broader patterns of early 20th-century migration. \nTogether, these perspectives offer fresh insights into one of history’s most studied maritime disasters, demonstrating that science will carry Titanic’s legacy forward as much as legend. \n  \nSchwankert’s new book The Six will be available for purchase and signing after the presentation. \nThis in-person event at the Explorers Club Headquarters will include an audience Q&A. \n\nStreaming live here on explorers.org, our YouTube Channel, and our Facebook Live — Monday, April 14th at 7:00 pm ET. \nRESERVATIONS\nThis will be an in-person lecture at Explorers Club Headquarters. \nIn-person tickets are $20 for Members, and $35 for the General Public. \nCheck-in will begin at 6:00 pm, with a beer and wine reception from 6:00 – 7:00 pm",

This community panel discussion at \nInterference Archive\n will stream live globally at \nradioalhara.net\n and also directly at \nThe Wonder Cabinet\n in Bethlehem, Palestine. \n\n\nThe goal of this event is to highlight the ways that cultural work is a key part of both broader community organizing practices and the contemporary movement to support Palestine. This discussion aims to highlight the ways that cultural work occurs as part of a process of exchange between artistic ideas but also organizational strategies that are built across grassroots organizing networks.\n\n\nThis panel builds on similar live community discussions with cultural workers that have recently taken place in other cities, also broadcast on Radio AlHara and hosted by Stefan Christoff, including in July 2024 at \nCasa do Comum\n in Lisbon, Portugal, in Amsterdam in Nov. at \nOT301\n, in Mexico City in Feb. 2024 at Radio Nopal (\naudio\n) and in Sofia, Bulgaria at the \nкоприва Feminist cultural space\n. \n\n\nInformation on the speakers and participating groups / collectives:\n\n\nDrawing from the personal and the political through resilience and persistence, \nYasmeen Abdallah\n references her Levantine lineage in the form of magic carpets, intimate weaving, and needle art practices. Abdallah seeks to create safe, mobile spaces in the face of occupying forces that cruelly and catastrophically fail humanity. She views the threaded needle as a tool of solidarity to rip through borders, unravel fictive allegories, and heal holes in tender hearts. Abdallah holds Bachelor’s degrees from University of Massachusetts in Anthropology (emphasis in Historical & Collaborative Archaeology, which included field schools with New England indigenous tribal communities); and another in Studio Art with honors, including a Minor in Women’s, Gender & Sexuality Studies. Abdallah also earned an MFA in Fine Arts with distinction from Pratt Institute. Her work as an artist, curator, writer, and educator is rooted in social engagement and collaborative work with various communities and DIY spaces including ABC No Rio; Art in Odd Places; Flux Factory; and Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space. She has been a visiting and teaching artist at institutions including New Museum; Pratt Institute; Sarah Lawrence; Residency Unlimited; BRIC; Kean University; Parsons; Children’s Museum of NYC; El Barrio Artspace; Fairleigh Dickinson; and University of Massachusetts. \n\n\nDancers for Palestine\n (D4P) is an autonomous group of dance workers who organize in solidarity with the global movement for Palestinian liberation. Formed during Israel’s genocidal attack on Gaza beginning in 2023, D4P seeks to both cohere and create a dance community which is vocal and active in its support of the Palestinian people. D4P is a local and international endeavor with a core organizing group in NYC and an ever expanding network of dancers and organizers. D4P’s work has included protest and direct action, political education events, art-based fundraising, and campaigns to move dance institutions into alignment with the Palestinian Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.\n\n\nFiber Friends of Falastin\n is an exploratory social activity for folks who have basic crochet, knitting, sewing, quilting, weaving, embroidery, (and more!) skills. Taking place at Interference Archive, this is open to all who are interested in building community at the intersection of textile-making and social movements, where work is created in support of Palestine. \n\n\nSam Sundos\n is a Palestinian-American interdisciplinary artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. Through his paintings & textiles Sundos references his experience as a Palestinian born & raised in diaspora while applying the use of traditional slow craft processes and cultural iconography. Through incorporating his personal experience to these processes Sundos’ hopes to use his voice to advance conversations centering around imperialism & its socioeconomic effects while remaining grounded in themes of indigeneity & tradition. In short, through his art, Sundos seeks to convey the significance of human touch and the value of every human life. Sundos has also recently founded \nUnibrow Sun\n, an organization prioritizing artists & activists whose work is focused on elevating narratives of solidarity through exhibitions, screening, workshops & printed material.\n\n\nTheater Workers for a Ceasefire\n exists to organize U.S.-based theater workers in solidarity with the people of Palestine. We aim to use our bodies and talents in pursuit of a comprehensive ceasefire, which we understand is merely the first step among many in realizing a Free Palestine.",

      "description": "NYC Parks is pleased to present Brooklyn Dreamland, Land without Shadows, an exhibition of paintings and drawings by Christopher Spinelli depicting a bygone era of Coney Island on view at the Arsenal Gallery.In the late 1980s, Spinelli was encouraged by illustrator Robert Weaver to get out of the studio and explore real life. Childhood trips piled in his father's car in search of crinkle-cut fries led him to the B train, where he rode to the end of the line. Equipped with a sketch pad and Polaroid camera, Spinelli produced many drawings and images of the then-declining amusement site. Regarding these initial works, he states, \"I began talking to the denizens of Coney Island, who were usually huddled in and around Nathan's for warmth; I drew them while they regaled me with their stories. Some of those first sketches are included in this exhibit.\" Inspired by buzzing neon signs and accumulated layers of peeling paint, Spinelli began producing the wonderfully garish acrylic works featured in this exhibition.Unlike his drawings, his paintings are rendered from childhood memory rather than present experience. He states, \"My paintings of Coney Island are vibrantly colored and thickly textured; I am painting not as I found it, but what I remember seeing in those fleeting images from the back window of that Delta 88 as we drove by.\" This exhibition is FREE and open to the public. For more information, visit nyc.gov/parks/art. A public opening reception will be held on Thursday, January 23, 2025, at 6 p.m. Image Credit: Christopher Spinelli, This Way to the Spookarama, 2021, acrylic paint, 36”x48”",

      "description": "NYC Parks is pleased to present Brooklyn Dreamland, Land without Shadows, an exhibition of paintings and drawings by Christopher Spinelli depicting a bygone era of Coney Island on view at the Arsenal Gallery.In the late 1980s, Spinelli was encouraged by illustrator Robert Weaver to get out of the studio and explore real life. Childhood trips piled in his father's car in search of crinkle-cut fries led him to the B train, where he rode to the end of the line. Equipped with a sketch pad and Polaroid camera, Spinelli produced many drawings and images of the then-declining amusement site. Regarding these initial works, he states, \"I began talking to the denizens of Coney Island, who were usually huddled in and around Nathan's for warmth; I drew them while they regaled me with their stories. Some of those first sketches are included in this exhibit.\" Inspired by buzzing neon signs and accumulated layers of peeling paint, Spinelli began producing the wonderfully garish acrylic works featured in this exhibition.Unlike his drawings, his paintings are rendered from childhood memory rather than present experience. He states, \"My paintings of Coney Island are vibrantly colored and thickly textured; I am painting not as I found it, but what I remember seeing in those fleeting images from the back window of that Delta 88 as we drove by.\" This exhibition is FREE and open to the public. For more information, visit nyc.gov/parks/art. A public opening reception will be held on Thursday, January 23, 2025, at 6 p.m. Image Credit: Christopher Spinelli, This Way to the Spookarama, 2021, acrylic paint, 36”x48”",

What kind of work actually goes into being a popular Twitch streamer? Is it really as simple as sitting down in front of a camera and playing your favorite game? (No, absolutely not.) And how does one even begin to cover that as a journalist and write a book that encapsulates it all, especially when the world of livestreaming never stops, not even for a moment?\nCome for answers to all of these questions and stay for never-before-told stories about your favorite/least favorite streamers.\nrsvp",

      "description": "Well well well another year of Tackycardia in the books. Massive appreciation to everyone who has supported us over these last couple of years whether it’s artists we’ve booked, VJs, flyer designers, staff at Wonderville, or y’all who just serially show up and dance/game. We very much weren’t expecting for things to last this long when we started this little experiment out but here we are heading into year 3 of 150+ bpm fuckery!\nHere’s what we’ve got for ya for our anniversary. Tackycardia alum DJ Allegation will be returning following appearances at Silo and Bossa Nova Civic Club. In addition, New England legend Jack McDevitt (also of Disco Ball Murder Kit) will be making the trek into NYC to treat us with some fresh sounds. Arpanette comes through following appearances at Eris and Café Kitsuné. Boj joins us following appearances at Happyfun Hideaway and the Cuff Complex while Tailz who heads Blast NYC comes following appearances at Eris, Trans Pecos and Hart Bar. The card will be rounded out by Tackycardia residents Cryostatik who recently put out 2 new tunes in Mess ‘Em Up and Solace as well as Alex Viper who is fresh off of December appearances at Tropical Dreams festival and Garage Sale in Massachusetts in addition to the Stuck on Earth reunion event in NYC. As usual not all of our lineup is known for their high BPM antics so we’re just as excited as y’all are to see what fantastic sets come out. Getting DJs and audiences alike a tad out of their comfort zones is one of our favorite things about doing these events and we are gonna keep it up :) Make sure to follow our instagram @tackcyardia_nyc as we’ll be posting a bit more about our artists in the lead up to the event!\nWe look forward to celebrating the occasion with y’all. As usual it’s a 150+ genrefluid affair with free entry and free to play arcade games. Donations are welcome to further support our events and can be made via cash in the tip bucket on the stage or via venmo through our QR code that you’ll see posted around the venue. Here’s to another year!\nrsvp",

The series will showcase some of the city’s most creative and dynamic musicians and center experimentation, exploration, and whimsy in an unconventional setting outside of a classic club or music venue. At any given event, there may be DJ sets, beat sets, rappers, live instruments, and more.\nFor the first edition, curator @\nkweku.nyc\nwill be joined by @cjf2002_ @pizzaqueenhaley @1ateshia, all DJs who like to go all over the place with their sets, pulling from a wide variety of genres and leaving crowds guessing what’s next. Release your expectations, and come dance with us.\nrsvp",
